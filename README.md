# Weather Modeling Project

## Overview

This project involves weather modeling using a quadratic equation solver implemented in stages. The objective is to understand the solution of quadratic equations and apply it to weather-related data.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

1. **Quadratic Solution Implementation**: Code to solve quadratic equations in stages.
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Notebooks that contain the code implementations and results.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks were used for developing and testing the quadratic solution. The notebooks are included in this repository and demonstrate various stages of the implementation:

1. **Stage 1**: Hard-coding variables and calculating solutions.
2. **Stage 2**: Using keyboard input to enter variables.
3. **Stage 3**: Reading variables from a file.
4. **Stage 4**: Handling a single set of inputs.
5. **Stage 5**: Managing multiple sets of inputs.
